## Two sum - difference equals to target



### Description

Given an array of integers, find two numbers that their`difference`equals to a target value.  
where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers \(both index1 and index2\) are NOT zero-based.

It's guaranteed there is only one available solution

### Example

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 15, 24], target = 5 
Output: [1, 2] 
Explanation:
(7 - 2 = 5)

```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1, 1], target = 0
Output: [1, 2] 
Explanation:
(1 - 1 = 0)
```
