## Two sum - closest to target

### Description

Given an array`nums`of_n_integers, find two integers in_nums_such that the sum is closest to a given number,_target_.

Return the absolute value of difference between the sum of the two integers and the target.

### Example

**Example1**

```
Input:  nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4] and target = 4
Output: 1
Explanation:
The minimum difference is 1. (4 - (2 + 1) = 1).

```

**Example2**

```
Input:  nums = [-1, -1, -1, -4] and target = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
The minimum difference is 6. (4 - (- 1 - 1) = 6).

```

### Challenge

Do it in O\(nlogn\) time complexity.





* 用一个数去记录difference
